//
// These are two separate JavaScript worlds that never share memory: the UI
// serialises a settings object into a `start({...})` source string and hands it
// to `JavaScriptInterface.runScript`. Nothing at runtime checks that the object
// the UI builds is the object `start()` expects -- a renamed key is a silently
// ignored setting, not an error.
//
// This file is the one thing both compilations include (tsconfig.json and
// tsconfig.settings.json), so the two sides are checked against the same type.
// Emits nothing.

/**
 * Every playable skill, as the game's own internal ids.
 *
 * This one string travels the whole width of the project: the settings UI
 * offers it in the Skill Type dropdown, it crosses the `start({...})` bridge,
 * the skill files register handlers under it, and the play loop compares
 * against it. Nothing at runtime ties those four together -- a mismatch means
 * `SkillHandlers[skillType]` misses and the skill quietly falls back to
 * "randomize and wait", which plays but never performs the choreography.
 *
 * Declaring the set here makes all four checked against one list. The comment
 * on each is the label the dropdown shows.
 */
// A `const enum` so the ids are written once and referred to by name. It is
// erased at compile time and every use inlines to the string on the right, which
// is also what lets one vocabulary span both compilations: the settings WebView
// and the device script are separate JavaScript runtimes that share no memory,
// so a runtime constant object here would have to be duplicated into each. A
// compile-time-only one does not exist at runtime at all.
//
// The member name is the label the dropdown shows; the value is the game's id.
