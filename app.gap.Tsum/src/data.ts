  // did nothing above 4, which is how this was noticed.
  //
  // 25 is measured, not guessed: nearest-neighbour distances between detected
  // circles on corpus/GamePlaying sit in a tight band at 24-26px. The rest of

// The selected tsum's icon: where the game draws it, and how it is reduced to
// something a library entry can be compared against.
//
// `icon` is the thumbnail inside the lower-right button on StartPage -- what the
// device reads before every round to say which tsum is about to play. The
// library it is matched against is not a photograph of that button: it is that
// button, rebuilt. The development tools' lexicon composites each tsum's own
// sprite into the game's own blank button at the transform the game uses, so a library entry
// and a live capture are the same drawing rather than two drawings of the same
// tsum. That is the whole reason the numbers below could be tightened.
//
// The rect is 1080x1920 logical coordinates and square, because it is squashed
// into a square grid and any other aspect would distort the drawing. Change it
// and the library has to be rebuilt: the lexicon reads this object when it
// writes `tsums.dat`, so the two cannot silently disagree.
//
// `maskBottom` and `maskRadius` are the parts nothing is read from, as
// fractions of the rect, masked on **both** sides: an entry and a query only
// mean the same thing if the same cells were dropped from each.
//
// `maskBottom` is the "Lv NN" badge the game draws across the icon's bottom.
//
// `maskRadius` keeps only an ellipse, which drops the corners -- not artwork on
// either side, but the orange button itself, and comparing that to itself is
// comparing the game's furniture. It also takes the store ribbon with it.
//
// Fractions rather than cell counts so that `grid` is a knob that only changes
// resolution. As counts they also changed *how much of the picture* was thrown
// away -- three rows is 19% of a 16-grid and 30% of a 10-grid -- which made a
// smaller grid look far worse than it is.
//
// `grid` is 16, re-measured on the rebuilt library rather than inherited: every
// one of the 769 tsums was matched at 12, 14, 16 and 20 while wearing real
// captures of the ribbon, the badge and a hint toast, and shifted, resampled to
// 1080p, gamma-shifted and JPEG'd on top. All four sizes name every tsum they
// are confident about correctly; 16 carries the best margin per byte, and the
// pairs still confusable at 16 are confusable at 20 as well, because they are
// the same drawing twice (`flynn` / `flynn2`).
//
// `minScore` / `minMargin` are the accept test, in the shape roundStats.ts
// already uses for digits -- a best match has to be good, *and* it has to beat
// the runner-up. The lexicon's `--verify` prints both numbers for every capture
// it holds.
var MyTsumPortrait = {
  // The library file, deployed beside index.js and read on the first round that
  // needs it. `magic` and `format` are its first line, and roundStats.ts
  // refuses a file that does not open with both -- a library cut through a
  // different grid scores against the wrong cells, which is a wrong name rather
  // than a missing one. The lexicon writes all three; they are here because

  // clears all three things drawn over the icon. The store ribbon comes in from
  // the top right, the Lv badge from the bottom, and a hint toast can sweep the
  // top left; sized against real captures of all three.

  // sits at 0.98 and only one falls under 0.80.
  //
  // So the score floor can be strict, and buys the case the margin cannot see
  // -- an icon the library does not hold at all, which a later game update will
  // produce. The margin can then be loose, which is what names the art twins
  // (`flynn`/`flynn2`) instead of leaving their cell empty. Measured together:
  // against 0.70/0.08 this names 97% of tsums rather than 91%, *and* invents a

// What a tsum looks like *on the board*, which is a different question from
// what it looks like in the pre-round button above.
//
// "Link MyTsum first" never identifies a tsum on the board -- `findTsums` finds
// circles and `classifyTsums` groups them by colour, so all `scanBoardQuick`
// does is pick the cluster nearest one reference colour. That reference used to
// be `sampleMyTsumColor()`, an 80x80 box at `Button.gameSkill1`; that point is
// the button's *tap* target, some 60 logical pixels below the portrait, so the
// box lands on the skill gauge and the reference tracked the gauge's charge
// rather than the tsum. Measured over four boards it missed the gate on all
// four, by 59 to 120.
//
// So the reference is precomputed instead, off the same block art the library
// is built from, and looked up by the shorthand `identifyMyTsum()` has already
// read. The lexicon's `board_colors.py` is the long form.
//
// Nothing in the bundle reads `width` or `background`: the derivation script
// does, out of this file, so a colour derived at one width and matched at
// another cannot happen. They were deleted once as unread and that stopped the
// library being regenerated for a week -- leave them.

  // is versioned on its own instead of refusing the library whole.
  // 'hsv31' was the HSV read at this width; 'chroma1' is the chroma plane's

// this list immediately before reading the score and coins
// (`statsScoreButtonsReady`), and taps the tally on while the row is missing,

// **overlap**. An ordinary round offers Close (x 97..502) beside Play
// (575..982); a round played as part of a point battle cannot be replayed from
// here, so it draws one centred Close (337..740) and no Play at all. Probing the
// old Close and Play spots read that row as a count-up still running: the wait
// spent its whole budget, the row went to the CSV with no score in it, and
// nothing then pressed a button the anchors also missed -- the stall guard
// bounced the game instead. x 355..495 by y 1549..1750 is inside the Close of
// both layouts, and `Page.ScorePage.back` presses the same overlap for the same
// reason.

// on the button's lit upper face, one on its shaded lower one. Both read the

// a row that has not arrived yet is 439 and 354 away.
//

// the row could not name the page until the count-up was over, which is how a

// Fever time, as four pixels.

// A fever is not a screen of its own -- it is the board with the lights turned

// `PageName` and is read on demand by `Tsum.isFeverTime` (src/fever.ts). This
// list is also what `Page.GamePlayingFever` adds to the HUD rail above, so the
// two answers cannot disagree.
//
// Two facts, deliberately, because either alone is a lie the screen tells often:
//
//   the ring is lit      the gauge's outline goes white while a fever runs, and
//                        it is drawn *over* a full-screen skill animation -- so
//                        this survives the frames where nothing else does.
//                        On its own it would also accept a bright fill on the
//                        ordinary gauge (it fills yellow, with its own glow).
//   the board is dimmed  the chrome behind the HUD drops from light blue to
//                        near-black teal. On its own this accepts every dimmed
//                        overlay the game draws -- the pause menu, the level-up
//                        panel and the Magical Time offer all darken the same
//                        pixels -- which is what the ring above is for.
//
// The dimmed pair is read beside the score capsule, where `LevelUpDimmedChrome`
// reads too, and not under the gauge where it used to be: the 2025 layout on
// MuMu (`mumu-360x640-fever*` in the corpus) ends the game in a black band
// below the gauge, so the two probes that lived there read (0,0,0) on every
// screen and no fever was ever recognised on that device. The capsule's
// flanks are chrome on both layouts. They dim a little less on MuMu --
// (8,52,74) against the older layout's (0,40,49) -- so the expected colour
// sits between the two and the threshold covers both: the worst fever frame
// is 69 away, the pause menu 37 (the ring rejects it by 325+), the level-up
// panel 95+, a plain board 350+. The ring strokes read up to 68 away on MuMu

  // heart and the cost pill being the only difference -- and `LevelCapRaised` is
  // `HeartSent`'s. A swept entry here would have more probes than either of
  // those and would take their frames, so these two answer `matches()` only,
  // which is all the unlock sweep asks: it has just pressed the button that
  // raises them. Probes are the flattest pixels on each (stability <= 5), since
  // `matches()` compares per channel at <= 20 and ignores the thresholds below.
  //
  // The aliasing runs the other way too, and that is worth knowing: a sweep over
  // the `LevelCapRaised` frame answers `Received`, whose `Received2` entry
  // passes on it with three probes to spare (errors of 16, 6 and 24 against a
  // threshold of 80). Its two cyan probes land on the toast's bands and its dark
  // one on the message strip -- the same three-band chrome. Harmless as it
  // stands, because every edge off `Received` is a tap the toast also swallows,
  // and it is what a device log means when it says the sweep saw `Received`
  // during a raise. Separating them wants a corpus frame of the real received-
  // items panel, which would show whether its OK button can be probed; there is
  // none, so `Received` is left alone rather than retuned against a guess.
  // `npm run pages:eval` reports the claim on the targeted row.

  // `HeartSent`, whose centre probe lands between this toast's two lines. Only
  // `awaitBoxDialog` asks for it, by name, right after pressing the button that

  //
  // What is this toast's own is the wording: two lines where the others centre
  // one. The (540, 884) probe sits in the gap between them, which reads the
  // panel here and a glyph on both twins (per-channel misses of 200 and 85), so
  // `matches()` refuses those. The rest is the chrome, for the device's benefit
  // -- eight probes on flat cyan and panel that say the toast is fully drawn.

  // either, against the 20 `matches()` allows. Every other corpus page fails on

  // --- Level Up, every way it is drawn -------------------------------------
  //
  // The screen lists one panel per tsum in the party, and the party is not
  // always five: the 5->4 bonus ("play with four tsums") takes one away, and a
  // one-tsum party collapses the list to a single panel. The stack stays
  // centred whatever its height, so the layouts do not merely shift -- they
  // interleave. Every four-panel row lands between two five-panel rows, the top
  // five-panel row (y 395-570) is empty board on the four-panel screen, and the
  // lone panel sits at y~960, which is the gap between panels on the
  // four-panel one.
  //
  // So there is no probe list that covers them all, and each configuration gets its
  // own entry under `PageName.TsumLevelUp`. Nothing downstream sees the difference:
  // `findPage()` reports the name, and every caller wanting "the level-up
  // screen" gets it whichever layout showed up. `variant` is for the corpus
  // tooling -- `npm run pages:eval` reports coverage per configuration, so a
  // layout with no entry reads as a missing fingerprint rather than as a
  // fingerprint that works half the time. The corpus's ANNOTATIONS.md lists them.
  // Five panels. `LevelUpDimmedChrome` proves the overlay is up; the four pill
  // probes below prove the stack is the five-panel one, and are chosen on
  // *drift* -- how differently the other two layouts draw the same pixel -- for
  // exactly that reason. Their separation is near zero and that is expected:
  // panel blue is panel blue wherever it is drawn, which is the whole trouble
  // the dimmed-chrome probes exist to fix.
  //
  // Two of the nine this entry used to carry are gone rather than moved:
  // (669,892) and (669,659) drifted 12 and 258 but separated 8 and 0, so
  // between them they said neither which page nor which layout. A probe that
  // measures nothing is not free -- `betterPageMatch` ranks on probe count, so
  // it is a vote for this entry over a shorter honest one.

  // score numbers move with the tsum's state -- an unowned tsum reads "You
  // don't have this Tsum yet" and has no score row at all -- so the text column
  // is not somewhere a probe can live, however flat it looks on one screenshot.
  // The gaps between panels are no better: they show the dimmed board, which is
  // a different picture every round.
  //
  // The margin probe sat at x 240 once, which a wide-eared icon reaches: Bianca
  // and Stitch in panel 2 both failed it, the panel went unrecognised, and the
  // tally wait -- which renews itself only on a page it can name -- gave up

  // the screen is also what the weekly ranking looks like. It reached seven of
  // nine on both friends frames, so a different friends list was all it took;
  // nine probes then outranked FriendPage's six, and the level-up Close at
  // (300,1660) is the hub's Card button. `LevelUpDimmedChrome` is what makes
  // that impossible rather than unlikely.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// How each page behaves once it is up.
//
// The distinction that matters to everything downstream is whether a page waits
// for you or leaves on its own:
//
//   PERMANENT  it is still there in ten seconds. Something has to tap it -- a
//              button, or a tap anywhere -- and until something does, nothing
//              else will happen. The navigation band taps these.
//   TRANSIENT  it dismisses itself after `durationMs`. Tapping it is worse than
//              doing nothing, because by the time the tap lands the page it was
//              aimed at is gone and the tap hits whatever replaced it. The
//              navigation band waits these out instead (`nav.wait.transient`).
//
// Durations are wall-clock at `PageBaselineFps` (60). The game runs these
// windows off a frame counter rather than a clock, so a device at 120fps shows
// a "10 second" page for about five; `PageRouter.durationOf` does that scaling
// from `PageRouter.fps`, which the "Device frame rate" setting feeds.
//
// A mapped type over `PageName`, so adding a name to the enum without saying how
// the page behaves is a build error rather than a page that quietly inherits
// somebody else's handling.
//
// `measured: false` marks a duration that was reasoned about rather than timed.
// `npm run pages:docs` lists those separately: they are the ones to replace with
// a stopwatch reading, not to trust.

// whole trick. The badge is a bright glyph about 30 logical px across sitting on
// a dark progress bar -- so one capture pixel of drift takes a single probe from
// 239/247/255 to the bar behind it, which is why the pixel-per-card table this
// replaced rated `risky` to `unusable` on half its entries. Six points spread
// over the glyph and a majority rule survives that: a shift moves some of them
// off the badge, never all six, and an uncapped card reads dark across the whole
// 30px window on every frame measured, so the two answers are never close.

//

// level-cap sweep's own table -- not evidence about which screen it is, which
// is `Page.TsumTsum2025StorePage` and is not touched by any of this. Read only
// by `Tsum.taskBuyBoxes` and its helpers (src/boxes.ts).
//
// Two things about this screen make it a table rather than a handful of
// coordinates, and both were measured off the corpus rather than reasoned out:
//
//   THE ROW MOVES.  The boxes are a row of tabs, three wide normally and four
//   while a limited-time box is running. It stays centred, so the two layouts
//   interleave and no single set of centres covers both -- exactly the problem
//   `PageDef.variant` exists for on the detection side. Which one is up is read
//   from the ends of the row: with three tabs the panel background shows at
//   both, with four a tab reaches into each.
//
//   SO DO THE BUTTONS.  A box with both purchase sizes draws them side by side;
//   one with only a 1-Time purchase -- Happiness always, and any box whose
//   10-Time has gone -- draws that one centred instead, over the gap the pair
//   leaves. So all three positions are read, and where a button *is* is what
//   says which layout was drawn.
//
//   AND NEITHER IS THERE AT FIRST.  The store fingerprints as itself the moment
//   its frame is up, about 1.5s before its contents arrive: until then the panel
//   is empty and the row is three placeholder slots with spinners. That frame
//   reads the panel at both ends -- which is exactly what a three-box row looks
//   like -- so width alone would name the three-box layout and lose the
//   limited-time box. The gold separates them: a drawn row always has one
//   selected tab, a loading one has none. Nothing moves while it waits, so no
//   settle catches it (DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 5).
//
// Sold out is a colour, not an absence: the button stays where it is and turns
// blue. That is what ends a sweep without anything having to count purchases.

//   ANCHORS   `mail`, `tsums`, `home` and `store` mean the same thing wherever

//             `AnchorRoutes` and the edge is read off whichever `Page` entry
//             matched. Adding the anchor to a new entry adds the edge.
//   PER PAGE  `back` and `next` mean whatever that screen's two buttons mean,
//             so they are declared per page in `PageRoutes`.
//
// Every edge carries a `RouteSource`, because the difference between a route
// the tree implements and one somebody believed is the whole point of writing
// them down. A page with no row below is not an error: `forecast.ts` still
// reports the fallback `back` tap, with no destination, which is what
// `nav.move.back` really does.
//
// `docs/transitions.json` is what checks this -- the detection suite's self-test
// reports an observed transition no edge admits and an edge no harvest has seen.
// The ledger is one harvest and twenty visits deep, so neither is a failure yet;
// a contradiction is still worth reading.
