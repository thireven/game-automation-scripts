// Gaston
//
// His activation changes nothing already on the board: for a window his skill
// level sets, every tsum that *drops* is a Gaston. So the activation is worth
// however much board gets cleared while it is open -- clear a chain of Gastons
// and the hole fills with more of them -- and the chain that clears it wants to
// take as much of the board as it can. A human playing him draws **one chain of
// about thirty**; measured off `debug/gaston_correct.mp4`, that is the whole
// skill.
//
// ## The chain is a snake from the top, not the longest path
//
// Read frame by frame, the human's thirty-chain starts at the top-left corner,
// sweeps right along the top row, drops a row, sweeps back left, drops, sweeps
// right -- a boustrophedon down the pile, and it stops where the Gastons run
// out. `gastonSnake` draws exactly that as a walk on the link-reach graph, and
// the part that took two tries to get right is **what a row is**. A
// pile is jumbled: the next tsum along a row sits ten or fifteen px above or
// below the last, so judging "same row" hop by hop read it as the row below,
// dropped, turned, found everything behind already visited and dropped again --
// a staircase down the diagonal, four tsums off the top row and fourteen in all
// (`debug/gaston_debug_1.mp4`). So the rows are found first, for the whole pile
// (`gastonRows`): a sweep down the sorted heights that opens a new row at a gap
// or once the row is a tsum tall. A hex pile's real rows come out as rows; a
// jumbled one comes out in bands a tsum tall, which is all a horizontal sweep
// needs. The walk then exhausts its row -- forward, then back for anything it
// passed -- before it drops, and it drops to the far end of the row below so the
// sweep back covers that row whole. Tried from both top corners, longest kept.
//
// **The walk backtracks.** Greedy, one hop with no way back, it stranded what
// it turned away from: on a jumbled pile the hop that looks like the next along
// the row is sometimes the only bridge to the rest, and the sweep took it,
// found nothing beyond and stopped. Two device rounds on 2026-09-20, 38 passes
// with board and route logged, planned 874 tsums where 999 were connected -- a
// third of the passes at 21 of 32, 20 of 29, 15 of 24. So the sweep is a
// depth-first search whose branch order is the sweep's preference: its first
// descent is the greedy walk, and a dead end is backed out of for the next-best
// hop, under a step budget (`snakeSteps`). Over those 38 boards it plans 980,
// the best route found inside the first few hundred steps on nearly every one.
// What it still leaves -- a top corner outside the biggest component, a row
// order no corner can complete -- the longest path the search finds over the
// same points takes (`findLongestTsumPath`, 992 of the 999), run only when the
// snake is short of the biggest component, since nothing beats a route through
// the whole of it. The game takes any hop inside its reach, so the shape is a
// preference and the count is the point.
//
// **The route is Gaston only, and Gaston is learned from the board.** The snake
// ran over the whole board array for a while, on the theory that a leftover of
// another colour the drag crosses is inert. It is not. The game links a tsum
// only while it is within reach of the chain's *head*, so the first leftover in
// the route leaves every Gaston after it two hops from the head, and the chain
// stalls there for good: `gaston_debug6.mp4` registered 14, 17, 2, 1 and 8 of
// routes planned at 29, 35, 15, 22 and 28, every stall on an ordinary 23-33px
// hop, while 43-44px hops inside the same chains linked fine. So the route is
// drawn over his tsums alone, and which clusters are his is decided by size and
// remembered by colour (`gastonGastons`). Gaston is one colour to the game and
// two or three to the scan -- a tan face under black hair, and the Hough centre
// lands on either -- but on a board the window has just filled the biggest
// clusters are his: they are taken until they hold `paletteShare` of the board,
// and the large ones go on `gastonPalette` for the window, so a hair cluster a
// later board's leftovers outnumber is still his. Matching the skill-button
// portrait was tried first and drew nothing: his face on blue is not his sprite
// on the board. `extraClusterSlots` keeps his second and third clusters in the
// board array whatever the leftovers do.
//
// Top-down rather than the bottom-first the other long chains use, on purpose.
// Rapunzel+ starts low because her window opens on a board still falling; this
// one opens on a board the count gate has just seen full and still. And the
// order pays for itself at the release: the cleared tsums are the top rows, so
// the pile below does not move and the refill drops straight into the space --
// where a chain taken from the bottom collapses the whole pile before anything
// new can land.
//
// ## Nothing here consults the chain settings
//
// "Maximum Chain Number" and "Chains per board scan" are tuned for ordinary
// play, where many short chains keep the combo alive. They are the wrong answer
// for every part of this skill, so `chainLimits` buys both of them out for the
// play loop between windows: the chain is **uncapped** and exactly **one** goes
// out per scan. The second half matters as much as the first -- the extra chains
// of a batch are planned on a board the first chain has already cleared, and on
// a Gaston board that is what turns one chain of thirty into a chain of twelve
// and two of three. Inside the window the snake consults nothing at all.
//
// ## The activation animation is 3.4 seconds and the window is 6
//
// So the window is anchored to the **end of the animation**, not to the tap.
// Measured off `gaston_correct.mp4` frame by frame: the tap lands at 8.0s, the
// board sits under a dark flexing figure until 11.4s, fills with Gaston by
// 13.5s, and the chain goes out at 14.3s. Anchored at the tap, a 6s window is
// over before the board is worth looking at -- which is exactly what
// `gaston_wrong.mp4` shows: five seconds of window spent scanning a board under
// the veil, then the play loop chaining fours across a board of twenty-six
// Gastons.
//
// The gate is **a full count that has stopped climbing, behind a floor** -- a
// count, not positions. A position gate was tried: the circles matched read to
// read, landed meaning nine in ten within 3px of a read ago. Run through the
// same Hough pass over the frames of a board that had visibly landed
// (`debug/gaston_debug5.mp4`, 3.0s to 5.3s), that share never passed 0.80 and
// mostly sat near 0.6: at a vote threshold of 10 the pass finds forty-odd
// circles of which a dozen are somewhere else on the next frame. So every gate
// ran to its ceiling and the window sat three seconds over a full board. The
// count wanders a few either way for the same reason, which is why "stopped
// climbing" allows `countNoise` (a refill landing climbs by several a read).
// What a count cannot see is a clear in progress -- forty popping tsums are
// forty circles for a while yet -- so the refill gate does not look before
// `fillMinMs`, long enough for a clear of any size to have taken tsums off the
// count, and a board that never reads full is taken at the ceiling
// (`fillWaitMs`) rather than by a "landed short" test the count cannot make.
// The floor (`openMinMs`) covers the activation animation, because a board that
// was full when the button went is still forty circles under the dim.
//
// ## The HUD is inside the play square
//
// The fever bonus and the combo counter are drawn across the top of the play
// square, over the pile's top row, and their glyphs -- the 0, 8, 9 and 2 of
// "48,202" -- are tsum-sized circles to the Hough pass. Ordinary play never
// meets them: they land in a small colour cluster the `uniqueTsumCount - 1` cut
// drops. This snake is colour blind and keeps every cluster, so they were in
// its board, at the top, which is exactly where it starts. Replayed offline on
// the boards of `gaston_debug5.mp4`, both routes began on the fever bonus
// digits and hopped through the combo counter; on the device those drags
// linked one tsum, then five. `gastonFreeBoard` cuts everything with its centre
// in the top `hudBand` of the square. That costs a real tsum or two on a pile
// stacked into the band (`corpus/GamePlaying/last_seconds1.png` has three
// there), and the snake then starts a row lower; every fever capture in the
// corpus has two to four glyph circles in the band.
//
// ## The last chain is not cancelled, and the tap follows a chain
//
// Gastons cleared while the skill is running do not fill the gauge; the ones
// cleared after it has run out do, and they fill it *as they pop* -- a thirty
// chain's clear is three seconds long (`debug/gaston_debug2.mp4`, 44.3s to
// 47.3s) and the gauge climbs through the whole of it. So the bubble cancel,
// which is exactly what cuts that animation short, is only for chains whose
// clear the skill still covers: a chain released within `noCancelTailMs` of the
// close, or after it, is left to pop in full, and it ends the window -- its
// Gastons popping past the close are the charge. A window that closes with no
// such chain out draws one more on the board as it stands, since what dropped
// before the close is still Gaston; nothing after that, because the refill
// behind it is mixed, and a colour-blind snake over a mixed board links one
// tsum (the "1" chains after the fever in `gaston_debug5.mp4`). The gauge is
// then watched through the clear (`gastonAwaitGauge`), and this hands back the
// moment it reads full so `useSkill` fires within a read or two -- a chain
// still clearing when the button goes spills the rest of its count into the
// fresh gauge, which is the overload `Tsum.link` is built around. That is also
// the rule when the gauge is already full at the close: the chain first, then
// the tap, so the burst has something to fill. A gauge not full by
// `gaugeWaitMs` is the play loop's: its chains fill it, and `useSkill` fires on
// the first read that says so.
//
// Two smaller things the window has to get right:
//
//   - **the drag must not cross a bubble.** One crossed mid-travel pops and
//     ends the chain there, and this chain crosses the board. Tsums sitting on
//     a bubble are held out of the plan, and the bubble is then spent
//     deliberately: tapped the moment the drag releases, which cuts the pop
//     animation short so the next batch of Gastons drops at once. That is what
//     makes a second pass fit in the window at all, and it is why bubbles are
//     the skill's rather than the Bubble Strategy's (`claimsBubbles`) -- nothing
//     pops one between windows, since a bubble there cancels a chain that is
//     filling the gauge; the surplus goes on the cancels instead. The bubbles
//     are read off a capture that runs below the play square (`gastonBubbles`,
//     `bubbleHem`): the square cuts the bottom row of them in half, and a third
//     of one window's passes went uncancelled with four in plain sight.
//   - **the drag has to be sampled, not flicked.** One `moveTo` per tsum at
//     10ms is under a display frame, so a thirty-chain can have its middle
//     sampled away. Same answer as Rapunzel+: dwell longer than a frame on each
//     tsum and sweep the gaps.

 *      lost. A row the walk has already been in (it stepped out for a
 *      straggler) is re-entered at its nearest tsum, which is where the sweep
 *      left off. Nothing turns here: rule 1 first takes whatever lies further
