// The freeze-window choreography as it shipped in 1.0, kept beside the
// reworked one (`src/skills/coronationElsa.ts`) so the two can be picked on
// the same Beta build and compared on the same boards. One capture per pass
// and a model of what each chain froze, where the current file reads the
// ice after every chain. Nothing in here is tuned any more -- a finding goes
// into the current file -- and every symbol carries `Legacy` so the two share
// one bundle. What follows is the 1.0 header as it was.

// Coronation Day Elsa
//
// The activation does not clear anything. It opens a freeze window -- 5s at
// skill level 1 up to 10s at level 6, `durationMs` -- and while it is open every
// chain linked freezes a line of tsums across the board, drawn between the
// chain's first and last tsum. Frozen tsums pile up, and one tap on any of them
// sets the whole pile off at once.
//
// So this is the only skill here whose choreography is *playing*, not aiming.
// The goal inside the window is coverage: freeze as much of the board as the
// chains on it allow, then set the lot off with one tap.
//
// ## One tap sets the pile off, so nothing may touch ice until the end
//
// That single-tap trigger is the hazard the whole window is played around: any
// contact with a frozen tsum spends the entire pile on however little has been
// drawn so far. This skill has popped prematurely three ways, all eliminated
// here and worth keeping on the record:
//
//   - **it burst after every pass.** A pass ends the moment the model stops
//     offering chains, so a starved scan made "one chain, then a 25-tap grid
//     sweep, pop" -- a tiny burst that looked like a stray bubble sweep. Now a
//     burst is a decision, never a reflex, and the decision is "no more chains
//     can be made": it fires when fresh captures keep agreeing the board is
//     played out with a real pile standing (`earlyBurst` in the config) --
//     refreezing the refill when there is window left to do it in, closing out
//     when there is not -- and the clock forces it only when just
//     `burstTailMs` of window remains, enough for the burst's own taps.
//     Passes keep capturing and chaining right up to that line. Between
//     bursts the only taps sent are the chain drags.
//   - **a drag could land on real ice the model called free.** Two ways in: the
//     band measurement bounds its half-width between 16 and 27px, and the model
//     claims only the lower bound, so a tsum in the ring between them can be
//     real ice while still in the plan; and a board mid-freeze carries ice at
//     more than one shade, so reading only the biggest ice cluster left the
//     other shades planned over. Now the ring is *quarantined* -- dropped from
//     planning without being counted frozen, until a later capture reads back
//     what it really was -- and every cluster inside the frozen colour box is
//     treated as ice, not just the biggest.
//   - **the next drag went out before the ice was there, and beside where it
//     landed.** Seen on device, not in the model: `coronation_elsa_debug1.mp4`
//     at 13.68s pops a 16-tsum pile for 94,680, 33ms after a 15-chain froze,
//     where the clean window at 1.9s took 106 tsums for 1,626,542. Two causes,
//     one on each axis. In time, `chainSettleMs` was 0 for the skill's whole
//     history, so the margin listed below was never actually taken. In space,
//     that chain snaked down the left of the board and froze *along its path*,
//     nowhere near the line through its ends -- which was all the quarantine
//     modelled. Now the wait is real, `elsaLegacyPathBandCover` quarantines the path
//     too, and `maxChain` bounds how far a chain can snake off its own ends.
//   - **a live tsum colour read as ice, and the phantom pile pulled the
//     trigger.** `coronation_elsa_debug2.mp4`: an event board whose palest
//     tsum sits inside the frozen colour box, so every scan read a standing
//     dozen-tsum "pile". That one misread fired everything at once: the
//     played-out confirmation was permanently satisfied, so each dry spell
//     burst early -- and the burst's blind grid popped whatever real ice the
//     last chain had just frozen (16.9s: one 10-chain, popped ~half a second
//     later). See "Reading the board through the ice" for the whitelist that
//     answers it, and note the blind grid now backs the *closing* burst only.
//
// Three margins on top of that, for a live device rather than the model:
//
//   - every chain is followed by `chainSettleMs`, so it registers and its band
//     starts forming before the next drag goes out;
//   - a candidate whose *drag* would pass within `dragClearance` of known ice
//     or a read bubble is not drawn -- `elsaLegacyPathIsClear` -- because a linkable
//     hop (47.5px) is wider than a narrow band, so a chain can straddle one
//     that a rescan has read back by colour with the line geometry forgotten,
//     and a bubble touched mid-drag pops and ends the chain there;
//   - after the burst the choreography keeps the board for `postBurstSettleMs`
//     (sweeping the bubbles a clear that size earns), then waits out the
//     window's tail, so the play loop's first chain cannot freeze a stray band
//     in the dying moments.
//
// ## The board does not move, which is what makes this cheap
//
// Measured off the four captures in `corpus/_unlabeled/Coronation_Day_Elsa`, by
// differencing consecutive frames over the cells that are unfrozen in both: the
// board reads 6.1 and 11.7 mean absolute difference per channel across frames
// two seconds and a new freeze band apart. The control is the same frame against
// itself displaced by a third of a tsum, which reads 64. So a chain drawn during
// the window freezes a band and clears nothing -- no erase, no collapse, no
// refill -- and the combo counter standing still at 11 across all four frames
// says the same thing from the HUD.
//
// Two consequences, and they are the shape of everything below:
//
//   - **one capture per pass, not one per chain.** Positions taken at the start
//     of a pass stay true for the whole of it, so re-scanning between chains buys
//     nothing and costs 200-300ms of a 5-10 second window.
//   - **what froze is modelled, not read.** The script drew the lines, so it
//     knows where the ice is. The model is a union: everything within
//     `bandHalfWidth` of the line through a chain's two ends (`elsaLegacyBandCover`),
//     everything that close to the path actually drawn (`elsaLegacyPathBandCover`),
//     and the chain's own tsums. The end line alone was not enough -- see the
//     third premature pop above.
//
// "Does not move" has three exceptions, and all of them are falls: the window
// opens on the refill from the batch the play loop linked just before
// activating, a pop leaves a gap for tsums to slide into, and a burst empties
// a pile's worth of board for the refill to drop through. A capture taken
// mid-fall reads tsums where they are passing through, and a chain drawn from
// it drags at air and freezes a gap into the pile. All three moments are
// ice-free by construction, which is where the settle gate in `elsaLegacyFreezePass`
// sits: an ice-free look that reads clearly fewer tsums than the board is
// known to hold (`settledFraction` of the best count seen) is a board
// mid-fall, waited out (`settleRetryMs`) and retaken rather than chained.
// Ice-free only, so the known under-read of an iced board -- frozen clusters
// eat colour slots, see the last section -- can never stall a pass.
//
// A pass that runs the model dry with window left does take a fresh capture --
// not because the board moved, but because the model errs on purpose: the
// quarantine ring above writes off more than is really frozen, and the capture
// reads it back. Real ice lands in the frozen cluster; a free tsum comes back
// free, and the next pass gets to chain it.
//
// ## Choosing the chain
//
// The chain cannot be aimed. It has to be same-coloured and connected, so the
// line through its ends is whatever the board offers rather than a direction that
// can be asked for -- there is no way to say "now do a horizontal one". What can
// be chosen is which of the chains that exist to draw next, and `elsaLegacyNextChain`
// is that choice: the one whose band takes the **least** off the board.
//
// That is the opposite of the obvious rule and it is what measured best, because
// freezing and consuming are the same act -- see the numbers on `elsaLegacyNextChain`.
// What comes out of it is close to the sweep the obvious rule was reaching for:
// narrow bands, drawn one after another, each over ground the last one left.
//
// So a pass is: capture once, then loop -- plan over the tsums the model still
// believes are free, take that chain, draw it, mark its band and its quarantine
// ring, and go again. `calculatePaths` is pure and takes no capture, so the loop
// costs drags and arithmetic only.
//
// Both chain settings are ignored in here: there is no per-scan chain limit to
// apply because there is no per-chain scan, and the length cap is the window's
// own `maxChain` rather than the setting's. It sits at 10, where a sweep from 4
// to 10 moved coverage by a single point -- so the bound costs about a point,
// and it buys a limit on how far a chain can snake off the end line.
//
// The window works the board **bottom-up** (`bottomFirst`), and that took two
// halves to make free. Ordering the candidates by height on its own costs about
// a point -- 66.6% against 67.4% -- and picking the lowest is worth the same as
// picking the highest, so it was choice thrown away rather than a direction
// earned. What pays for it is asking `calculatePaths` for low *starts*: the DFS
// tries its starts in degree order, ties are the common case, and breaking them
// by board position anchors each candidate at the bottom of its own component
// without costing a single tsum of length. Ordering those anchors is then free
// -- 67.1% against 67.0% at 1000 boards -- because the bottom chain is now also
// a chain worth drawing.
//
// Free, note, and not better: these are boards on a centred lattice, so the
// harness scores the discipline and not the bottom. Nor is there an argument
// from the board's physics -- a chain clears nothing, so nothing falls while
// the window is open, which is why `elsaLegacyBurstFrozen`'s taps go top-down and the
// chains have no reason to follow them. What it buys, if anything, is on a real
// board: a pile is dense at the bottom and ragged at the top, and a window that
// runs out of clock has then spent it on the half with the tsums in it.
//
// The limit worth knowing about: `calculatePaths` returns the *longest* chain per
// colour component, so the pick is the best of a handful of candidates rather
// than the best chain that exists. Generating candidates by endpoint separation,
// or by band offset, is the next lever if coverage turns out short on a device.
//
// ## Bubbles hole the bands, and break the chains drawn over them
//
// A bubble on the board hurts the window twice. It is a tsum-sized hole in
// every freeze line drawn through it; and a drag whose travel crosses it pops
// it *mid-drag*, which ends the chain right there -- a short chain, a short
// band, and from the outside "the chains are disrupted whenever a bubble is
// around". A big burst *earns* bubbles, so left alone each burst seeds the
// next one's disruption. Four answers, cheapest first: `beforeActivate` spends
// whatever the cycle's own scan still holds, aimed, before the window opens; a
// pass that reads an ice-free board with bubbles on it pops them aimed off its
// own capture and looks again after the fall, up to twice, so no chain is ever
// planned off pre-pop positions (see `elsaLegacyFreezePass`); a bubble that survives
// to the chaining -- unpoppable under standing ice, or missed -- becomes a
// *drag obstacle*, kept clear of by the same `elsaLegacyPathIsClear` check that
// keeps drags off the ice; and the post-burst blind sweep stays behind all of
// it, for bubbles `findGameBubbles` misses -- its radius range is reasoned,
// not yet calibrated. Aimed pops only ever happen with no ice read, because a
// tap is what sets a pile off.
//
// ## Reading the board through the ice
//
// A frozen tsum still detects as a circle and still gets a colour, so it becomes
// an ordinary colour cluster. Every cluster inside the frozen colour box is
// treated as ice -- its tsums are never planned over (a drag onto one is the
// premature pop above) and never counted as coverable. `orderPaths` runs the
// same read for the play loop's own scans, and any ice it sees there is
// leftover by definition -- the choreography waits out its own window -- so it
// bursts it on sight rather than only filtering around it.
//
// The box has a converse hazard, and it is the fourth premature pop above: a
// live tsum can sit inside it. The event board in coronation_elsa_debug2.mp4
// carries a pale ice-blue fluffy tsum whose cluster reads (h~99, s~95-100,
// v~214) through the scan path -- in the box -- so every scan flagged a dozen
// live tsums as a standing pile. One false colour poisons everything at once:
// the board's biggest colour is never chained, the phantom satisfies
// `earlyBurst.minIced` for ever, the settle gate and the aimed bubble pops
// never run (both need an ice-free read), and between windows every scan
// "bursts" the phantom -- ~28 taps at nothing, every scan.
//
// The answer is a whitelist read when ice is impossible. Until the round's
// first window opens no ice can exist, so any cluster the box matches on
// those scans is a live colour: remembered for the round (`elsaLegacyIceAlikes`),
// never flagged frozen after that. Real ice measured clear of that board's
// ice-alike -- less saturated and brighter, ~24 away in cluster HSV against
// the `iceAlikeMatchDist` bound of 15 -- so the whitelist cannot eat a true
// pile whose shade stays where it was measured.
//
// Where the colour box came from, and what it is not, is `CoronationElsaLegacyConfig`
// under "Tuning data" above.
//
// ## The ice used to eat the board's colours, and that was most of the loss
//
// The board scan keeps its biggest `uniqueTsumCount - 1` colour clusters --
// four in an ordinary game -- and a frozen tsum is an ordinary cluster to it.
// So every shade the ice reads at took one of those four slots, and with ice
// measured at three shades that left *one* live colour of five. A colour
// without a slot is not merely left unchained: it is not in the board array,
// so no pass can plan over it and no capture hands it back.
//
// That is what "there were obvious chains it never drew" was. Costed on the
// harness at `--slots=4 --iceShades=3`: coverage 48.5% against 57.8% with every
// colour visible -- nine points, more than any selection rule in this file is
// worth -- and the leftovers concentrate where the ice is not, which under the
// bottom-up sweep means the top and the sides.
//
// The answer is `extraClusterSlots` on the skill declaration, four of them:
// three for the measured ice shades and one for the colour the ordinary cut
// drops. Declared rather than set while the window is open, because the scans
// *between* windows are what `elsaLegacyIceAlikes` learns from -- a pale live colour
// that only appears once the window widens the cut is a colour the whitelist
// never saw, which is the phantom pile again. Recovery is monotonic in the
// harness: 5 slots 54.7%, 6 56.2%, 7 57.2%, 8 57.8%.
//
// ## Known, and left for a second iteration
//
// Ice at more than three shades still costs a live colour, and a board whose
// ice reads at one shade spends three slots to find that out. Sizing the
// allowance off what the last scan actually read as frozen would fit both, and
// needs the scan to hand back what it dropped.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// --- Tuning data ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// ## Reading a frozen tsum
//
// A frozen tsum is drawn as pale blue ice over whatever it was, which puts it
// somewhere no ordinary tsum on these boards sits: bright, and barely
// saturated. `frozen` below is that box, in the HSV `findTsums` samples and
// `classifyTsums` averages into a cluster centre (hue 0..179, OpenCV's range).
//
// Measured off corpus/_unlabeled/Coronation_Day_Elsa (four captures, one board
// with no freeze on it and three with progressively more) against every
// corpus/GamePlaying frame, through the real capture path with the scan's own
// HSV conversion and 22px blur reproduced over it. Frozen clusters came out at
// (h 103, s 74, v 222), (h 107, s 79, v 222) and (h 116, s 62, v 229); the
// nearest thing to them anywhere else was an ordinary blue Sadness tsum at
// (h 108, s 131, v 174) on the same boards, and a pale end-of-round flash at
// (h 142, s 73, v 216). Saturation is what separates the first pair and hue the
// second, and both margins are wide.
//
// NOT MEASURED ON A DEVICE. The sampling above is a grid over the play square
// rather than the circle centres `findTsums` reads, because the offline host
// shim has no houghCircles -- so treat these as the box the *colours* sit in,
// which is what they are, rather than as a device calibration.
var CoronationElsaLegacyConfig = {
  // How long the freeze window stays open, by skill level 1-6, in ms.
  durationMs: [5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000],

  // NOT MEASURED. It is also unknown whether the game starts the window at the
  // activation tap or when the animation ends; this assumes the tap, which is
  // the pessimistic reading and costs a scan rather than a missed burst.
  leadInMs: 600,
  // The slice of the window the closing burst's taps actually need -- the
  // aimed taps plus the blind grid, ~28 taps of round time. This is the only
  // time reserved off the clock now: passes keep capturing and chaining until
  // just this much window is left, and the burst fires earlier only when
  // fresh captures confirm no more chains can be made (see `earlyBurst`).
  // Replaces `burstLeadMs`, which parked the board for the last 900ms.
  burstTailMs: 600,
  // The least room before the burst deadline worth starting a fresh pass in:
  // a capture plus one chain. With less than this left, the capture alone
  // would push the burst's own taps out past the window's close, for a look
  // nothing could act on -- so the burst fires instead.
  passMinMs: 400,
  // Longest chain the search may return while the window is open, as
  // calculatePaths' own cap -- where 0 means no cap at all.
  //
  // The "Maximum Chain Number" setting is deliberately ignored in here. It caps
  // chains at 3 by default, which is the right answer when a chain is worth what
  // it clears; a freeze line is drawn between a chain's two *ends*, so in this
  // window a chain that crosses the board is worth far more than three short
  // ones.
  //
  // Capped rather than off, because the model's error grows with length. The
  // ice forms along the chain's *drawn path*, and the end line is only a good
  // stand-in for that path while the chain is short -- a long one snakes far
  // off its own ends (see `elsaLegacyPathBandCover`). The cap is set where the
  // measured cost is: sweeping it from 4 to 10 moved coverage by a single
  // point, so 10 buys the bound for about a point. `npm run elsa:coverage`
  // now says it is free -- capped at 10 reads the same 66.0% as uncapped over
  // 100 boards, and only a cap of 4 gives up a point.
  maxChain: 10,
  // EXPERIMENTAL -- work the board bottom-up. Two halves, both on this flag:
  // `calculatePaths` grows each candidate from the lowest tsum it can start on
  // and tags it with that `startY`, and `elsaLegacyNextChain` takes the lowest anchor
  // first. Every other rule is untouched -- the narrowest-band rule still
  // decides between candidates on the same level, and the clearance filter and
  // the quarantine are where they were.
  //
  // Costed at `npm run elsa:coverage -- --bottomFirst=0/1`, and it is free --
  // 67.1% against 67.0%, 1000 boards on each of three seeds. Flip this to
  // false for the plain narrowest rule, which also stops the pathfinder being
  // asked for low starts.
  bottomFirst: true,
  // How close two anchors sit and still count as the same level, in the 200px
  // play square. At 0 the lowest anchor simply wins and the narrowest rule
  // only breaks exact ties; wider, a level is a band of the board and the
  // narrowest rule chooses inside it.
  //
  // Swept at 1000 boards: 0 reads 67.1%, 13 reads 67.0, 27 reads 66.8, and a
  // band wide enough to admit everything (which is the low starts alone, with
  // the pick left as it was) reads 67.0. So the hybrid is the worst of the
  // three and strict depth costs nothing -- the sweep is worth more than the
  // half-measure, and the ordering is worth having only if the bottom of a
  // real board is worth something the lattice cannot show.
  bottomBandPx: 0,
  // Half the thickness of one freeze band, in the 200px play square the board
  // scan works in -- so `Config.tsumWidth` (25) is one tsum. What the coverage
  // model asks of every remaining tsum is whether it lies within this of the
  // line through the chosen chain's two ends.
  //
  // Measured off the same four captures, by differencing the frozen mask between
  // consecutive frames: the band that appears down the left side between elsa2
  // and elsa3 reads 31-54px wide. That reading is inflated by the scan's own 22px
  // blur, which spreads the mask by up to 11px each way, so the band itself is
  // roughly 1 to 1.5 tsums thick and its half-width is under one tsum radius.
  //
  // Deliberately at the *narrow* end of that. Over-claiming makes the model
  // believe the board is finished when it is not, and stops the window early.
  // The other direction -- a tsum that is really ice but modelled free -- is not
  // this number's problem any more: `avoidHalfWidth` below is what keeps the
  // next chain's drag off it.
  bandHalfWidth: 16,
  // How close to a drawn line the next chain may reach, same units. Everything
  // within this is *quarantined*: dropped from chain planning, but not counted
  // frozen unless it is also inside `bandHalfWidth`.
  //
  // This is the upper bound of the same band reading, where `bandHalfWidth` is
  // the lower -- the gap between them is the ring the measurement could not
  // pin down. A tsum in that ring may really be ice, and a drag that touches
  // real ice sets the whole pile off, which spends the window's entire freeze
  // on however little has been drawn so far. So the ring is kept out of chains,
  // and the next capture settles what it actually was: real ice joins the
  // frozen cluster, and a free tsum comes back as itself.
  avoidHalfWidth: 27,
  // How close a drag may pass to a tsum known to be frozen, same units --
  // about one tsum radius. The quarantine keeps a chain's *tsums* off the ice,
  // but not the finger's travel between them: a linkable hop is
  // `tsumWidth * linkReach` = 47.5px, wider than a narrow band, and a rescan
  // reads ice back by colour with the line geometry forgotten -- so two free

 * pass waits `rescanIdleMs` before the next look, so a starved board does not
 * spin captures; dry passes that keep coming with a real pile standing are
 * the played-out confirmation (`earlyBurst`) -- spent-and-refrozen with
 * window left, the closing burst itself with the window nearly out.
 *
 * `expectTsums` is the population of the board the play loop scanned before
