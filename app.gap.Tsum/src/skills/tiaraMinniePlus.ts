// Tiara Minnie+
//
// The skill shows Minnie with a thought bubble holding one present, then a
// screen of presents to pick the match from; a fresh bubble comes with every
// pick. Both halves are read by cropping fixed boxes and comparing the pictures
// directly: the bubble is always drawn in the same place, and the presents
// always land on the centres in TiaraLayouts.
//
// Nothing here works out how many presents are on screen. Every centre from
// every layout is scored against the bubble and the best-matching one is
// tapped, and two centres from different layouts that sit on the same present
// are both right answers. Offline this picked the correct present on all 20
// frame/design pairs, and kept doing so with every centre shifted by up to 25px.
//
// That is not the same as "the tap cannot go anywhere bad", which this comment
// used to claim. Most centres belong to layouts that are not on screen: for a
// four-present screen only 11 of the 20 sit on a present, and the other 9 point
// at bare board. Nothing rejects a winner for being one of those, so the whole
// design rests on the *right* candidate winning. It does, comfortably, once the
// presents have arrived -- 0.62 against 0.25 for the runner-up on a recorded
// frame -- but on a frame taken while they are still sliding in, a foreign
// centre wins instead. Hence the gates in tiaraPick, and hence coverageFloor:
// the failure being defended against is a tap taken too early, not a matcher
// that cannot tell two presents apart.
//
// Timing is the whole game here, and the margins are thinner than they look.
// Measured at 10fps over the three activations in
// tiara_minnie_debug/tiara_minnie.mp4: the thought bubble is on screen for
// ~750ms, the presents become tappable 550-650ms after it goes, and they stop
// being tappable ~1150ms after it. So there are two windows of about half a
// second each, and missing either one costs the activation and resets the
// 2-to-6 progression exactly as a wrong present would. On the recording the
// script missed the third activation outright: the choice screen timed out
// untouched.
//
// What makes those windows workable is that the game clock is stopped for the
// whole skill -- not just the choice screen, but the activation animation and
// the bubble too (the recording's timer holds for 5.5s across each activation
// while ticking once a second either side). So captures taken in here cost the
// round nothing, and the windows above are wall clock, not game clock.
//
// That is the shape of most decisions below: the free resource is *looking* and
// the scarce one is *elapsed time*, so the sweep is one batched read, and the
// bubble is read up to three times across the same settle wait rather than once
// at the end of it.
//
// It is not a licence to look as often as possible, which was tried and made
// things worse on the device even though the offline harness liked it at every
// capture cost. See pollMs below. Two things came out of that: the poll
// intervals are back where they were, and the check that a tap is trustworthy
// no longer rests on how fast the loop happens to spin -- confirmGapMs is a
// wall-clock separation between the scan that proposes a centre and the scan
// that confirms it, so it means the same thing on any device.
//
// The timings that would settle it are now in the ordinary log on every pick
// and every miss: scans taken, what a scan cost, how long the screen had been
// readable. Read those before changing any interval here.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// --- Tuning data ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// A correct pick adds a present to the next activation's screen (2 up to 6); a
// wrong one resets it to 2 -- which is why every layout below has to be
// handled, but also why the count never needs tracking between activations.
//
// The presents always land on the same centres for a given count, so there is
// nothing to search for: crop each known centre, crop the bubble, and compare
// the pictures directly. Centres are logical 1080x1920, read off five reference
// frames -- one per layout -- whose blob centres agreed within ~20px.

  // and once at the end of it, and keeps whichever has the larger mask. A
  // single read at the end of a fixed sleep loses the whole activation whenever
  // the first sighting lands in the bubble's last 250ms -- the read then hits an
  // empty cloud, the template comes back with no cells, and tiaraPick returns

  // matches things: over the recordings, a template read at cloud 0.29-0.38
  // picked the wrong present on *every* frame of the choice screen it cleared
  // the gates on -- 15 of 15 twice over, once for 467ms straight, which two
  // agreeing scans would have walked into. Those templates carry 26-29 cells,
  // so dreamMinCells never saw them.
  //
  // Measured on the same capture the match uses (V and S are already there, so
  // this costs no extra grab), the fade-in reads sit at 0.29-0.40 and the open
  // bubble sits on a 0.43-0.45 plateau. Fade-out drops away just as fast, and

  // screen -- on the recording, a 4-cell template picked a centre no present
  // was on. Real templates ran 48-77 cells there and the reference bubbles
  // bottom out around 12 (8% of the grid), so this only cuts off the scraps.
  dreamMinCells: 10,
  // After the bubble clears, the presents take about a second to arrive. Waiting
  // most of that out first means the matcher never sees the hand-over frames.
  //
  // This lead and pollMs have to be read together: matching starts at (however
  // late the poll noticed the cloud go) + this. Trading one against the other
  // by their averages is what caused wrong taps -- pollMs 100->200 raises the
  // mean lag by 50ms but the *minimum* stays 0, so taking 100ms off this lead
  // moved the earliest possible start from 500ms to 400ms after the bubble
  // cleared. It is the earliest start that decides whether the matcher can see
  // a present still sliding into place, and a present caught in transit can sit
  // convincingly on a centre belonging to another layout.
  //
  // 500 was too much of a good thing. Measured on three recorded activations,
  // the presents become tappable 550-650ms after the cloud goes and stop being
  // tappable ~1150ms after it, so at 500 plus the poll's own lag the first scan
  // landed at or after the window opened and the second one landed on its edge.
  // Trimmed rather than cut: the whole gain is in already by 400, and what
  // makes the trim safe is coverageFloor, which was added after the wrong taps
  // described above and rejects every hand-over frame in all three recordings.

  // The game clock is stopped for the whole skill, not just the choice screen.
  // Measured off the recording by watching the timer digits: it ticks once a
  // second throughout ordinary play and then holds for 5.5s across each of the

  // presents alike. So a capture taken in here is free in the only currency the
  // round is scored in, and these were briefly dropped to 40/30 on that basis.
  //
  // They are back at 100 because the device disagreed with the model. Offline,
  // faster polling was better at every capture cost tried, from 40ms to 320ms;
  // on the device it came out slower to pick and more often wrong. The offline
  // harness cannot see what would explain that -- whether getScreenshotModify
  // blocks for a fresh frame (so polling faster buys nothing and costs
  // overhead), whether it can hand back the same frame twice (which would make
  // two "agreeing" scans one scan), or whether the extra captures simply
  // contend with the game's own rendering. Until a log from the device says
  // which, the cadence stays where it was for the years this worked.
