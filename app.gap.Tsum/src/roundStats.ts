// Round stats
//
// One row per played round, appended to <storage>/tsum_record/stats_<YYYYMMDD>.csv
// -- one file per day, named for the day the round was played. A row carries
// when it was played, which build of the script played it, how long it ran, the
// final score, coin and medal totals off the score page, and the in-game coin
// counter as it stood when the round ended.
//
// The engine has no OCR, so the digits are read here. Each field is a fixed
// rectangle: crop it, mask it to the digit colour with inRange(), take one
// bounding box per glyph from findContours(), squash each glyph to a 10x14
// bitmap and compare it against the templates below. The game draws every
// number in the same typeface -- the big orange score and the white coin
// counters normalise to the same shapes -- so one template set covers all of
// them. A box the mask joined across two glyphs ("44" on the dimmed HUD) is
// cut back into them first (`statsSplitJoined`).
//
// **Which screen a field is read on is part of the measurement, not an
// implementation detail.** Both of the numbers this file gets wrong, it gets
// wrong by reading the right rectangle at the wrong moment:
//
//   base coins   the in-game counter, read off the TsumLevelUp panel. The board goes
//                on paying out for seconds after the round timer stops, so the
//                counter holds the round's figure only once that is over, and
//                the level-up panel is the first screen that is certainly after
//                it. It also dims the HUD behind it, which is why that region
//                carries its own colour cutoffs.
//   score,       all read off the ScorePage, and only once its button row is
//   final coins  up: the page arrives counting the numbers up from zero and
//   medals       holds the row back until it has finished.
//
// **Medals move two of those.** A game carrying medals draws a medal counter to
// the left of the in-game coin counter, and a medals row between the exp and
// coin rows of the tally -- so both coin figures sit somewhere the rectangles
// aimed at them used to be background. The two screens are told apart
// differently, because what is cheap on each differs:
//
//   the HUD      one rectangle spans the whole counter row and the reader
//                returns its fields (`readStatsNumbers`). One field is coins
//                alone; two are medals then coins. Nothing has to be recognised,
//                which matters on a panel still fading in.
//   the tally    `ScorePageMedalRow` is scored on the frame that already had to
//                be taken to see the button row, so the layout costs no capture
//                and the three rows stay separate rectangles.
//
// A tally with no medals row is the game saying none were earned, so `medals` is
// 0 there rather than blank.
//
// A glyph that matches nothing well enough fails the whole field, which is
// written as an empty cell. Guessing would be worse than a gap: the numbers are
// the only reason the file exists. Note that the floating window is composited
// into getScreenshot(), so a log panel expanded over the top of the screen sits
// on the in-game coin counter and that field will come back empty.

// 540 emulator and a 1080 phone -- then the two pixels a quarter of its samples
// disagreed on that a '3' gains a lead by. Over that set the worst genuine
// digit scores 0.807 with a 0.036 lead over the runner-up. Recut the same way
// from fresh frames if the game ever changes its typeface.
//
// Cut from tally-size glyphs as much as score-size ones, because that is where
// a template goes wrong: a stroke is two pixels of this grid there rather than
// three, and twice a bolder template cost a whole field. The old '5' had a
// three-row top bar where the game draws one, so on the coin row it read as
// '6'. The old '9' closed its loop with two full-width rows where the game
// draws a thin loop and a hooked tail, so at 20px it was 0.021 from '0' --
// under `StatsMinGlyphMargin` -- and every coin figure with a 9 in it was
// written blank. The tally's bonus and high-score rows are in the sample for
// the same reason: they are the only place the corpus draws a small '6' or
// '8', and the 1080 phone's halved '8' had read as '3' without them.
//
// The medals row is its own size. On the 540 emulator its glyphs come out 19px
// tall where the coin row's are 20 -- the row sits half a pixel off, so the
// antialiased top and bottom land at 214, just under the white floor -- and a
// '0' cut that way has a thinner lower-left stroke than the coin row's. With
// no such '0' in the sample it led '9' by 0.029, one thousandth under the
// floor, and every tally with a '0' in its medal count was written blank. Two
// of those tallies are in the sample now, and the '9' lost the two pixels of
// its lower loop that a '0' cut short shared with it.

// in `src/tsums.dat`.
//
// That library is not photographed, it is reconstructed: the development
// tools' lexicon draws each tsum's own sprite into the game's own blank button at the transform the
// game uses, so a library signature and the icon on screen are the same
// picture. Which is why the thresholds beside it can be as tight as they are.
//
// Same shape as the digit reader above, for the same reason: crop, shrink,
// sample once, compare against templates, and require the winner to be both
// good and clearly ahead. A tsum that matches nothing well enough is written as
// an empty cell -- guessing which tsum played a round would poison exactly the
// comparison the column exists for.
//
// The library serves both builds of the game and carries a name per build,
// because each prints its own: English on the global one, kana on the Japanese
// one. Which to show is read off the focused package (`Tsum.gameBuild`), not
// off a setting, so the banner says what the screen says.

 * Both conditions, because the page arrives counting its numbers up from zero
 * and only puts its buttons out when that finishes -- so "the score page is on
 * screen" is not yet "the score page is showing the round's score".
 *
 * The count-up is not sat through: a tap on the tally skips it, and the game
 * draws the final figures with the button row at once. So a look that finds the
 * tally still counting taps it (`StatsBlindTapSpot`, inert once the row is out)
 * and looks again, retrying every `StatsSkipTapMs` while the row stays away.
 * Only when *this* look named the tally, never on the panels that stand over
 * it: the new-record, rank-up and event screens are cleared by their own
 * dismiss handlers inside `detect`, and a tally uncovered still counting is
 * simply seen and tapped on the look after.
 *
 * One window at a time rather than one budget for the lot. Arriving and counting
 * up are two waits for two different things, and a round whose post-round panels
 * ran long used to hand the count-up whatever the arrival had left -- often
 * nothing. `StatsScorePageMaxWaitMs` is what bounds the renewals.
 *
 * This is a *wait*, not a navigation: its looks carry no goal, so the
 * navigate band is silent and the only handlers that can clear the screen are
 * the guard and dismiss bands. That is deliberate -- `nav.move.unknown` taps
 * blind, and on this screen a blind tap can land on Play and start another
 * round -- but it does mean anything standing in front of the tally has to have
 * a dismiss handler of its own, or this loop just watches it until the budget
 * runs out. The failure log below is what says which screen that was.
 *
 * The other thing tapped blind is an unreadable screen *after* the tally has
 * been seen -- something standing in front of a tally that already arrived.
 * That is an event's result overlay, drawn in the event's own colours, so there
 * is no fingerprint to keep current from one event to the next; what holds is
 * that every one so far advances on any tap. The same spot is inert on the
 * tally and on the panels that share its moment, and the window is renewed
 * while the tapping goes on, since the loop is then acting rather than
 * watching; `StatsScorePageMaxWaitMs` bounds it as before. The count-up tap
 * renews nothing: the window it runs in is the count-up's own.
 *
 * The polling also drives `record.baseCoins`, which reads the coin counter off
 * the level-up panel this loop passes through on the way.
