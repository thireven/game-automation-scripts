// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The level-cap sweep: buy every raise the collection is offering.
//
// A tsum stops gaining levels at its cap, and the game sells the next few for
// coins. Sorting the collection by Level Lock puts every capped tsum at the
// front of it, so the sweep is: rewind to the first page, then repeatedly read
// the eight cards and raise the first one still wearing a padlock, until a page
// has none and a page turn finds none either.
//
// It re-reads rather than walking slots 0..7 off one reading because a raise
// takes its tsum out of the group the collection is sorted by, so the cards can
// shift underneath -- DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 6, which is also why the rewind is
// unconditional (§ 7) and why the toast is tapped rather than waited on (§ 4).
//
// Five hops, and every one waits to *see* the screen it asked for rather than
// sleeping at it, which is what the twelve blind taps this replaced could not do:
//
//   TsumsPage       -- the sort dropdown          -> TsumSortOrder
//   TsumSortOrder   -- Level Lock, then Close     -> TsumsPage
//   TsumsPage       -- a card, then the raise coin-> RaiseLevelCap
//   RaiseLevelCap   -- OK, which spends the coins -> LevelCapRaised
//   LevelCapRaised  -- a tap anywhere             -> TsumsPage
//
// The collection is left in Level Lock order rather than put back the way it
// was. Nothing else in the script reads that order, and leaving it is what makes
// the next run's first card the next capped tsum.
//
// `awaitPage` is the wait every one of those hops goes through, and boxes.ts
// borrows it -- hence its `event` parameter, so a Box Buying timeout is not
// filed under this sweep.
//
// The second thing here is the Auto Unlock MyTsum Level flow, which raises one
// cap -- the selected tsum's -- when the post-round level-up panel says it is
// capped. It shares the sweep's last three hops (`raiseSelectedLevelCap`) and
// none of the sort or the grid: the collection opens on the MyTsum, so there is
// no card to find. The panel read is only the trigger; the collection is the
// authority, and coins are spent only once the greyed "MyTsum Set" button says
// the panel shows the MyTsum and the gold padlock says a raise is on offer.

 * Does the post-round level-up panel show the MyTsum at its level cap?
 *
 * The MyTsum is the panel's first card, and a capped card draws a "Raise level
 * cap!" pill with a white padlock where the others draw an EXP bar. The card is
 * *found* off the gutter column rather than assumed at a row -- three layouts,
 * and a stack still bouncing into place on the frame that first names the page
 * -- and the padlock is read at its middle. `LevelUpMyTsumCard` (data.ts) says
 * why each number is what it is.
 *
 * Null when this frame has no card to read: the panel still arriving, or a
 * first run that is not the height of a card. `unlock.myTsum.read` carries
 * every answer, with what it was read off.
