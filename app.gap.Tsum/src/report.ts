// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Issue reports
//
// A bug report from a player is usually "it got stuck last night". By the time
// they say so the screen has moved on, the log has rotated and the debug lines
// that would have explained it were never written. This is the answer: one
// folder per report, holding the screen, the screens before it, the machine's
// own configuration and the last few hundred log records -- including the debug
// ones, which `logRingPush` keeps whether or not they were written out.
//
// Two ways one is made, and they are the same folder either way:
//
//   reportIssue(reason, note)  a person pressed something -- the settings page's
//                              Report button, the Quick Bar's chip, or a long
//                              press on the host's Log chip
//   reportOnLogged(...)        the script noticed its own failure. `ReportTriggers`
//                              below is the list, and the logger is what checks
//                              it, so no call site has to remember
//
// **Not gated on a developer setting.** The corpus recorder and the debug shots
// are, because they are collected deliberately; a report is collected by someone
// who has already hit the bug and will not have turned anything on first. What
// bounds it instead is the pruning: `ReportMinIntervalMs` between automatic
// ones, `ReportMaxPerRun` in a run, and `ReportsKept` folders on the disk.
//
// The frames are written in the corpus triple format (`corpusSidecar`), so
// the detection suite replays a reported screen unchanged and its report opener
// can drop it straight into the unlabelled corpus. A report is therefore a
// regression test that has not been labelled yet, which is the same trade
// `corpus.ts` makes.
//
// The host is what gets it off the phone: Run History's Share button zips this
// folder with the run's slice of `script.log`. Nothing here talks to a network.
