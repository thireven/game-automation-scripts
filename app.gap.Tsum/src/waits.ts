 * frames rather than milliseconds -- so the guess is only right on the device it
 * was made on, and it is the slower device it is wrong on, where the next tap
 * lands inside the animation and is swallowed by it (DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 4).
 * Watching the animation instead needs no frame rate to be configured.
 * DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 5 is the rule, and where it must not be used.
 *
 * `maxMs` is a budget, not a duration: this returns the moment the screen holds
 * still, so a generous one costs nothing on a fast device and is what a slow one
 * needs. Poll cost is `ScreenSettle`'s sixty probes off one capture.
 *
 * False means the budget ran out with the screen still moving, or the run
 * stopped. Neither is fatal -- the caller was going to sleep blind anyway -- so
 * only a caller with something better to do than carry on need look.
