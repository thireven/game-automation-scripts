// Box Buying -- buying boxes in the Tsum Tsum Store.
//
// Navigate to the store, open the box the settings name, press its 1-Time or
// 10-Time purchase, confirm, tap through the reveals, and go round again. It
// ends on the game's own signals -- the purchase buttons turning blue ("Sold
// Out"), "Not enough Coins!", or the 10-Time button refused because the box is
// almost sold out -- and on its own purchase limit, which is there because none
// of those is something a chore that spends the player's coins may rely on
// arriving (DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 8).
//
// The refusal is a toast, not a blue button: the store keeps the 10-Time button
// gold once the box holds fewer than ten and answers a press with "You can't
// use 10-Time Purchases" (`Page.BoxTenTimeRefused`). What the sweep does then is
// the size setting's call (`BoxPurchaseSize`): `Ten` ends it there, and
// `TenThenOne` drops to the 1-Time button for the rest of the box.
//
// **Rubies are never spent.** The "Not enough Coins!" dialog offers to trade
// them, and this sweep presses Cancel and stops. So does `dismiss.notEnoughCoins`
// (pageHandlers.ts) wherever else the dialog turns up, and the `Page` entry
// points both its anchors at Cancel so no generic mover can press the other
// button either.
//
// The screen geometry -- the tab row, the buttons, where a reveal is tapped --
// is `BoxStore` in data.ts, with what was measured and why.
//
// `awaitPage` is borrowed from levelCap.ts, which is what its `event` parameter
// is for: a timeout here is filed as `Log.Box.PageMissed` rather than under the
// sweep the wait was written for.
