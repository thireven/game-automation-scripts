// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The page router: one place that decides what is on screen, and one queue that
// decides who gets to act on it.
//
// ## Why this exists
//
// Screen recognition used to be four functions on `Tsum` (`scorePage`,
// `findPageObject`, `findPage`, `matchesPage`) plus a per-entry `onDetect` hook,
// and every consumer wrote its own reaction inline: three navigation loops with
// near-identical `switch (page)` bodies, a corpus capture here, a stats sample
// there, a Magical Time cancel in three separate places because three separate
// loops could be the one that saw it. Nothing knew what anything else did, and
// two of those reactions firing on one frame -- one tapping, one reading -- read
// or tapped a screen the other had already changed.
//
// So detection is centralised here and its result is *broadcast*. Anything that
// wants to react registers a subscription instead of writing another branch, and
// the router runs those subscriptions one at a time, in a defined order, with
// the rule that the first one to touch the screen ends the round.
//
// ## The four things it owns
//
//   DETECTION   `sweep` scores every `Page` entry against a captured frame and
//               picks the best (see `betterPageMatch`). This is the *only* copy
//               of that logic; every offline harness loads the built bundle
//               through `tools/runtime/` and calls straight into it.
//   BROADCAST   every detection produces a `PageEvent`; `changed` says whether
//               the screen actually turned over since the last one.
//   THE QUEUE   subscriptions are grouped into `PageCategory` bands with fixed
//               priorities, ordered within a band, and topologically sorted by
//               their declared `after` dependencies. One at a time, so there is
//               no interleaving to race.
//   HISTORY     a bounded stack of visits, with the frames saved to disk when
//               debug is on -- which is what turns "it got stuck sometimes" into
//               a sequence you can look at.
//
// ## Permanent vs transient
//
// A permanent page waits for input: it is still there in ten seconds, and the
// only way past it is a tap. A transient one dismisses itself after a while, and
// tapping it is worse than useless -- the tap lands on whatever replaced it. The
// two need opposite handling, so every page says which it is (`PageProfiles` in
// data.ts) and the navigation band waits transient pages out instead of tapping
// them (`nav.wait.transient` in pageHandlers.ts).
//
// Transient durations are wall-clock at `PageBaselineFps`, because the game
// counts these windows in frames: a device running faster shows the page for
// less time. `PageRouter.fps` scales them (see `durationOf`).

   * alone would be backwards, since it averages: a one-probe entry that matched
   * by luck would outscore a nine-probe entry that matched genuinely, which is
   * how `ClosePage` (a deliberate single-pixel catch-all) would swallow real
   * pages.
   *
   * `Config.pageMinMargin` can additionally reject a win that is too close to a
   * differently-named runner-up; it defaults to 0, which never rejects.
   *
   * `timeout` is a retry budget spent *only when nothing matched* -- a frame the

   * only where the caller is genuinely *waiting for* a page to arrive.

   * what the screen it is watching can turn into -- `inRoundPages()` from the
   * play loop, `heartSweepPages()` from the heart sender, both read off the
   * roles each page declares. It is a filter and nothing else: scoring,
   * ranking and the margin gate below are untouched, and omitting it scores the
   * whole table exactly as before. Two things it buys, in that order:
   * a page outside the set can no longer win by being the last entry still
   * passing over an obscured screen, and the entries outside it cost no native
   * crossing. It cannot be a router-wide rule, because `this.page` is only ever
   * as fresh as the last detection -- see the `via` hop in `navigate` -- so the
   * knowledge has to come from the caller.

  /**
   * Is *this* page on screen? Used where the caller already knows what it

   *
   * DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE, not an oversight. This runs its own comparison --
   * `isSameColor(..., 20)`, per channel, ignoring each probe's own `threshold`
   * -- where `sweep` uses `absColor` against the threshold. So the same row in
   * `Page` means one thing here and another there.
   *
   * Unifying the two on `score` is the obvious cleanup and is deliberately not
   * done yet, because it is not the loosening it looks like. Compare the rules
   * on ReceiveHeartWithoutCoins, whose seven probes all carry threshold 30:
   *
   *   error per channel   old (each <= 20)   new (sum < 30)
   *   (25, 0, 0)          fails              passes
   *   (15, 15, 15)        passes             FAILS
   *
   * JPEG error spreads across all three channels, so the second row is the
   * common case and the switch would make this page *harder* to match, not
   * easier -- and this is the "did the mail item come without coins" test, so
   * failing it takes the wrong branch silently. `npm run pages:noise` put the
   * q80 error at 20-90 near screen detail, the same order as the whole budget.
   * The capture is lossless now, which weakens that argument without supplying
   * the frames that would settle it -- these three pages still have none.
   *
   * To finish this: collect frames for ReceiveHeartWithoutCoins,
   * ReceiveSkillTicket and ReceivePremiumTicket (the only three pages reaching
   * this function), then swap the body for `this.score(...).pass` and confirm
   * with `npm run pages:eval` that those frames still match.
   *
