// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Everything the script does about a page, in one list.
//
// These are the subscriptions `gPages` runs when it has decided what is on
// screen. Before the router existed each of them was a branch inside whichever
// loop happened to be looking at the time -- which is why the Magical Time
// offer was cancelled in three places, why an unrecognised screen was only
// captured for the corpus if a navigation loop was the one that saw it, and why
// two of these could act on the same frame in an order nobody had chosen.
//
// Reading this file top to bottom is reading the dispatch order, because that is
// how the queue sorts: by band (`PageCategory`), then by `order` within a band,
// then by registration. `npm run pages:docs` renders the same thing as a table
// per page, and the studio's Dispatch tab shows it live.
//
// Four rules worth knowing before adding one:
//
//   * A subscription is a list of `steps` (globals.d.ts), not a body. Taps,
//     settles and sleeps are data, so `PAGE_DISPATCH.md` states every budget
//     and `tools/dispatchEval` pins every one of them. `call` is the escape
//     hatch, for what is neither a tap nor a wait.
//   * Whether a row ends the queue is its *band's* answer: guard, dismiss and
//     navigate touch the screen unless their `acts` declined, and everything
//     after such a row would be reading a frame that no longer exists. The
//     notify band is the exception and runs anyway -- it records what was seen.
//   * `every: true` means "fire on every look", not just when the page changed.
//     The navigation movers need it -- they tap the same page repeatedly until
//     it gives way. Everything else should stay on the default.
//   * The `navigate` band runs only on a look made with a goal -- which
//     `gPages.navigate()` does and nothing else -- and never on the destination
//     page. That is what lets the play loop call `gPages.detect` without
//     anything tapping the game away.
//   * `pages` is required and there is no wildcard. A handler for every page
//     says `allPages()`, one for every transient page `pagesOfKind(...)`, one
//     for every page carrying a button `pagesWithAnchor(...)` (pages.ts) -- so
//     what a page's queue holds follows from what that page declares, never
//     from a handler that forgot to say.
//
// A `tap` names an anchor of the entry that matched, never a coordinate: the
// variants of a page put the same button in different places, and the two
// Magical Time layouts put Cancel 135px apart.
//
// `gPages.validate()` at the bottom checks the one rule the types cannot: an
// `after` names something registered, in the same or a higher band.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// --- Waiting for what a tap started ----------------------------------------
//
// Every mover below taps and then has to let the screen it asked for arrive
// before anything looks at it or taps it again. These were fixed rests, which
// is a guess at an animation the game draws in frames rather than milliseconds
// -- right on the device the stopwatch was held against and short on any slower
// one, where the next tap lands inside the animation and is swallowed by it.
//
// They are `Tsum.settleScreen` budgets now (`ScreenSettle`, data.ts): the wait
// ends when the screen stops moving, so it is the device that decides how long
// it took. A budget is a ceiling and not a cost -- a fast device spends far less
// than the rests it replaced.
//
// One wait is deliberately still blind: the board. A round is animating from
// the first frame to the last, so a stillness gate over one can only ever time
// out, and `nav.move.startToGame` and `dismiss.resumeGame` keep their sleeps.
