// --- the board colour model ------------------------------------------------
//
// How a sampled tsum becomes three numbers to cluster on.
//
// Hue is an angle, and the model this replaced treated it as an ordinary
// number twice over: `cv::blur` averaged it linearly across the 0/179 wrap,
// and `classifyTsums` averaged it again into a running cluster mean. Both are
// wrong at the wrap, and red lives there. Measured over 674 red tsums on one
// recorded round, 3% of them read within 15 of red's true hue; the rest spread
// over the whole wheel with a mean of 82.6, which is where green reads (81.2).
// A red tsum was merged with a green one 22% of the time -- about as often as
// with another red (35%).
//
// So hue and saturation go down as one vector on the chroma plane, and value
// is carried separately at a weight:
//
//     (S * cos H, S * sin H, ChromaValueWeight * V)
//
// which fixes both averages at once -- there is no wrap to cross, and the mean
// of several vectors is a vector. It also disarms the other failure: a washed
// out tsum has a tiny radius rather than a wild angle, so the koalas stop
// scattering (same-colour agreement 23% -> 45%). Plain BGR was tried and is
// better than either on an evenly lit board, but it ties colour to brightness
// and collapses when the board dims -- which is what a fever stage does.
const ChromaValueWeight = 0.5;

// What counts as the same colour on the chroma plane -- the old model's 15 does
// not carry over, because the axes are not the same lengths.
//
// Swept over three hand-labelled boards (same-type and different-type tsum
// pairs) and every second of one recorded round, against the old model at its
// own 15, which merged 52.0% of same-type pairs and 2.9% of different-type
// ones for a longest chain of 4.05 and a 4+ chain on 40% of boards:
//
//     40   63.7% same   2.2% wrong   chain 4.39   4+ on 57%
//     45   67.0% same   3.4% wrong   chain 4.91   4+ on 69%
//     50   70.9% same   5.1% wrong   chain 5.75   4+ on 84%
//
// 40 is the point that beats the old model on *both* counts rather than trading
// one for the other. A wrong merge is a drag the game will not link, so the
// higher rows are worth having only if live play says those cost little.
const ChromaMergeDistance = 40;

// --- the texture axes -------------------------------------------------------
//
// What the chroma plane cannot do is tell two greys apart. A silver helmet, a
// black-and-white rabbit and a black-and-white dog all blur to a colour of
// chroma radius 7-19 -- the origin of the plane -- and differ only in value,
// at half weight: the Mandalorian, Oswald and Goofy read 22, 33 and 54 apart
// by `distance3D`, so the first two always merge and the third often joins
// them. 117 of the library's 765 tsums sit below saturation 60, where hue means
// nothing, so any roster holding two of them is exposed the same way.
//
// What does tell them apart is the picture inside the circle, in grey: how
// much it varies (a white face against black ears, or an even silver) and how
// bright it gets (a white face reaches ~250, silver ~220, the dog's muzzle
// ~230). Both are read off the board gray the Hough pass already built, from
// `TextureDisc` -- 57 points on four rings inside the head -- and carried on
// the point as `contrast` and `peak`. Measured over composite piles of the
// game's own board art: the contrast reads 36 / 62 / 52 for those three at a
// spread of 3-5, the peak 220 / 250 / 229 at a spread of 1-2; on real captures
// a pure grey cluster spreads 4-9 on the contrast and 4-7 on the peak, twice
// that under a fever or last-seconds tint. At weight 2 apiece the helmet sits
// 80 from the rabbit and the rabbit 46 from the dog; the helmet is 38 from the
// dog, still inside the merge distance, and that pair is the residual.
//
// GATED, not simply added. Sampled over every board in the corpus at these
// weights, a saturated tsum's texture varies with its tilt and its neighbours
// enough to split a real cluster in half, and a saturated colour never needed
// the help. So the axes count in full only between two samples both under a
// chroma radius of `TextureGateFull`, fade to nothing by `TextureGateOff`, and
// a chromatic tsum's distance is exactly what it was. Over the twenty-one
// in-round captures this changes four: two merges it undoes (a white Buzz from
// a grey elephant, a black-and-white face from Donald) and two where one tsum
// moves. On composite piles of the roster above the play loop's refused drags
// go from 26% to 4% at the default chain cap of 3, 35% to 13% at 5. On six
// phone captures of Mandalorian boards -- beside Oswald, a penguin, Mickey and
// Baymax, two of them in fever -- the plain distance merged the helmet with
// the black-and-white tsum on every one (20-33 of ~40 circles in one cluster);
// with the axes the helmet's cluster is pure on all six, and what remains
// merged is two black-and-white tsums on one board (Goofy with Oswald, Goofy
// with Mickey). A colour carrying no texture -- a library colour, a palette
// entry, the studio's synthetic points -- gets the plain distance.
