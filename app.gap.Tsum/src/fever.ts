// Fever time: reading it, and telling everyone when it turns over.
//
// ## Why it is not a page
//
// Everything else the script recognises is a screen: it arrives, it is
// fingerprinted, something reacts, it leaves. A fever is not that. It is a
// *mode* the board is in -- the same GamePlaying screen with the lights turned
// down and the gauge at the bottom turned into a glowing timer -- so it has no
// `PageName`, it does not displace whatever else is on screen, and the play
// loop keeps running straight through it.
//
// That is also why the state cannot be read off the page router's verdict. The
// table does carry a `GamePlayingFever` entry, but its `variant` is
// documentation and tooling by contract (see `PageDef` in globals.d.ts) -- the
// script only ever learns the page *name*. So the mode is read here instead,
// from the same `FeverProbes` that entry is built from, and the two answers
// come from one list of pixels rather than two.
//
// ## What this file gives you
//
//   ts.isFeverTime()      one look, no memory: is a fever running right now.
//                         Pass a frame you already hold and it costs nothing
//                         but the probe read.
//   ts.feverRemainingMs() how long the fever on screen has left, off a crop
//                         of the bar's fill taken right then -- cheap enough
//                         to ask inside a link batch, and never a clock of
//                         its own, so a fever the game has paused reads as
//                         paused. Gate it on `gFever.active`.
//   gFever.active         the debounced answer, as of the last reading, plus
//                         when it started (`since`, `elapsedMs()`).
//   gFever.subscribe()    a handler called once when a fever starts and once
//                         when it ends -- the broadcast the rest of the script
//                         reacts to, in the shape `gPages.subscribe` already
//                         uses: unique ids, one at a time, and a subscriber
//                         that throws does not cost the others their turn.
//
// Readings arrive from `record.feverTime` in pageHandlers.ts, which feeds
// `update()` every time the router looks at the screen. That is what makes the
// events fire on their own during a round without anything else calling in.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Consecutive readings that have to agree before the state flips.
 *
 * A fever runs for seconds, so one late reading costs nothing; a single wrong
 * one costs a pair of spurious events. This is the guard against a reading
 * that was *taken* and came back wrong -- a probe caught mid-transition, the
 * ring drawn a frame late. The other failure, a frame the router could not
 * read at all, is not debounced here at all: see `FeverUnknownHoldMs`, which
 * refuses it as evidence rather than counting it as two.

const FeverConfirmSamples = 2;

/**
 * Shortest gap between two captures taken to read the fever state, in ms.
 *
 * The play loop asks the router what is on screen once per scan, which can be
 * several times a second, and each reading here is a capture of its own. A
 * fever lasts several seconds and its edges only have to be caught within one
 * `FeverConfirmSamples` window, so most of those looks buy nothing.
 */
const FeverSampleGapMs = 300;

/**
 * How long an unreadable screen may hold the fever state up, in ms.
 *
 * `update` is fed whatever the router matched, and mid-round "nothing matched"
 * is an ordinary frame rather than a rare one: a burst skill's full-screen
 * animation and the level-up banner both cover the HUD, so the board stops
 * fingerprinting for a second or more while a fever underneath it runs on. A
 * fever is *not* one of those any more -- `GamePlayingHudProbes` were measured
 * on the six fever frames and move by at most 12 against a 40 threshold, so a
 * plain fever still reads as `GamePlaying` -- which is exactly what makes an
 * `Unknown` mid-round mean an overlay on top of one.
 *
 * Taking that at face value would end and restart a running fever in a pair of
 * spurious events, and `FeverConfirmSamples` is no defence: the play loop asks
 * several times a second, so two disagreeing readings arrive in well under the
 * animation's own length. So an `Unknown` is treated as *no reading* rather
 * than as "no fever" -- the same refusal `inRoundPages()` makes in the play loop,
 * for the same reason (`OBSCURED_BOARD.md`).
 *
 * The window is bounded because "no reading" cannot be allowed to mean forever:
 * an app that went away, a screen the table has never had an entry for, and the
 * state would sit `active` with nothing left to correct it. Past this, an
 * unreadable screen is ordinary evidence again -- so one that stays unreadable
 * ends a fever `FeverConfirmSamples` readings later, a little over a window
 * after the board was last seen. Measured from the last frame the router could
 * read, so a screen flickering between the board and an animation keeps
 * holding, and one that goes and stays dark does not.
