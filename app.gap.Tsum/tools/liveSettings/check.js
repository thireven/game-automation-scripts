// Checks the live-settings contract: when each setting reaches a run in
// progress, and whether the code agrees with what it says it does.
//
//   npm run live:check
//
// ## Why this exists
//
// Three bugs, all the same bug. The Box Buying rows had no `case` in
// `quickBarApplyOne` and so did nothing until the script was restarted. Twelve
// of the rows a preset carries had none either, and `applyLiveSettings` dropped
// them in silence -- a preset built around a skill arrived without the bubble
// strategy that makes it work. And the skill, 5>4 and the Lorcana card had a
// case when they should not have: written onto a board already dealt they left
// the play loop reading it as something it is not.
//
// What none of the three had was a written-down answer to *when does this reach
// a run?* `LiveSettings` (src/quickbar.ts) is that answer, one entry per
// setting, and this checks the answer against the behaviour.
//
// ## How it checks
//
// By running the real built bundle in a vm and driving it, not by reading it.
// A parse would only prove the `case` labels exist; this proves the switch
// takes the key, that `quickBarState` reports it, that the value survives the
// round trip, and that a `NextRound` key really does leave the world alone. The
// only things parsed are two flat literals -- `SettingKey` in `src/shared.d.ts`
// and `SHARE_SLOTS` in `src/settings.ts` -- because both are const enums by the
// time they reach the bundle, so the names are gone from it.
//
// Eight checks:
//
//   declared   every row a preset carries (`SHARE_SLOTS`) is in `LiveSettings`
//   switch     `Now`/`NextRound` keys have a case, `Restart` keys have none,
//              and no key outside the table has one
//   reported   `quickBarState` reports every `Now`/`NextRound` key and no other
//              setting -- the invariant the settings page depends on, since it
//              pushes back what it cannot see
//   roundtrip  what the apply says it took is what the state reports. This is
//              the one that catches a unit conversion: `skillWaitingTime` is
//              seconds on the form and `ts.skillInterval` is ms, so a state
//              line that forgot to divide would have the panel and the run
//              trade values forever
//   timing     a `NextRound` key changes nothing outside `pendingSettings`
//              until `quickBarApplyPending`; a `Now` key changes the world at
//              once. Structural, so it needs no per-key knowledge: every live
//              case writes a primitive on `ts` or on `Config`
//   stable     a held key reports the same value before and after the whistle.
//              `quickBarSetAside` does not clamp -- a range lives in its `case`
//              -- so a held key with one would show the pages a value the
//              switch then quietly changed under them
//   whistle    the play loop still calls `quickBarApplyPending`. The one thing
//              here that is read rather than run, because running it would mean
//              a round: without that call every held setting would be set aside
//              and never applied, and every check above would still pass
//   entry      no page entry point calls `sleep()` or a touch injector. Those
//              are the host's pause gate, and a page only ever evaluates these
//              while the run is paused -- on the service thread that also reads
//              the Resume. Driven back to back on purpose, because the bug this
//              caught (0.12) only showed on the second log line
//
// ## What it cannot decide
//
// *Which* of the three a setting is. That is a judgement -- does a pass read
// this during a round, against a board dealt before the change? -- and this
// only enforces that the judgement was made and that the code matches it. The
// table is where it is recorded, which is what makes it reviewable at all.
